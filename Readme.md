# Dislab
Making a distributed system based on Raft. This project follows MIT's 6.824 and is thus a learning project. 

This project is in progress.

## [lab 1]
In lab1, we make a map-reduce framework to distribute the general map and reduce workflow on multiple threads. Crash recovery is implemented on the framework.

To run the program, just follow the test file
```
cd src/main && sh test-mr.sh
```
